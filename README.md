Then they will be redirected to the Home screen of the app which they can navigate to leads, opportunity and activity.

the homescreen will have a drawer on the side. which have Admin Panel and About us screen.


## **To Do**

* maybe redesign the interface to be more attractive
	* maybe change the color scheme.

* Fix the avatar image for each tiles of the leads and opportunity(image not show up or maybe because the customer profile in the system does not have image)
